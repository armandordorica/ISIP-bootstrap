  <h2>GridCell Biological System Simulator</h2>
  <h3>About GridCell</h3>
 

  <p>GridCell is a stochastic simulator which divides the simulation space into a 3D cubic grid composed of discrete voxels. The simulation advances through time in discrete time steps. <br>It allows the analysis of biological and chemical networks under multiple spatial influences such as molecular crowding and localization.
